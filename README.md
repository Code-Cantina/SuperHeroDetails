# SuperHeroDetails
*You will need to get your own API key, its free from https://superheroapi.com/index.html. I have no affiliation with them.

## Description
* Simple app to display hero details from a public API located at https://superheroapi.com/index.html
* Was re creating a horizontal image scroller that adjusts content size as it scrolls/pages, updates data for active cell
* Search capabilities
* Used native network calls instead of implementing AlamoFire like I normally would for funzies.
* 100% programmatic UI

## Screen Shots

### Frameworks
* UIKit


## Lessons Learned
* For collection views, paging enabled only really works for full page width cells.
* I did not use any  packages for networking like I normally would. While relatively simple to get going, in order to do proper error handling more code would be needed. I appreciate Alamofire more.


## TODO
* Could use more styling for the hero details.
* For stated above reasons, more error handling.
* Move strings used to file for localization purposes.

## How To Get
* Clone/Fork
* Get your SuperHero API key from https://superheroapi.com/index.html
