# SuperHeroDetails


## Description
* Simple app to display hero details from a public API located at https://superheroapi.com/index.html 
* Was re creating a hoizontal image scroller that adjusts content size as it scrolls, updates data for active cell
* Search capabilities
* Used native network calls instead of implementing AlamoFire like I normally would for funzzies.
* 100% programmatic UI

## Screen Shots


### Frameworks
* UIKit


## Lessons Learned
* I did not use any  packages for networking like I normally would. While relativly simple to get going, in order to do proper error handling more code would be needed. I appriciate Alamofire more.


## TODO
* Could use more styling for the hero details.
* For stated above reasons, more error handling.
* Move strings used to file for lcoalization purposes.

## How To Get
* Clone/Fork
* Get you SuperHero API key from https://superheroapi.com/index.html
